# SQL-Project-Online_Bookstore

 I designed a SQL database that manages all the data related to books, customers, orders, and genres. I created and executed a variety of SQL queries to perform different operations, from simple data retrieval to more complex analysis. This includes things like finding specific books, calculating total sales, identifying popular genres, and analyzing customer purchasing behavior. Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to use SQL to manage and analyze data effectively for an e-commerce bookstore platform
